                Hello,
                <br/>
                <br/>
                My name is Kiishi Abudu. I am a background design artist and illustrator based in Lagos, Nigeria. I really love world building and creating pieces that are fun to me; and whoever finds them fun as well.
                I have worked on different art projects, from portraits, to comics, concept art, animation, collections, personal projects... I love what I do.
                <br/>
                Welcome to my digital canvas.
            </p>
